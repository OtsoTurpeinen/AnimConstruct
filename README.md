# AnimConstruct
Blender tool plugin for animation creation.

## Features
Generate animation for all selected objects.
- Translation
- Euler Rotation
- Scale
- Set frame count per object
- Set overlap between object animations (currently cannot be greater or equal to frame count)

## Original Purpose
I made this to create animations to visualize construction of cell-based wooden building material. Scale and Rotation features were added in later version to see if they could be used to create something like into logo video in a video game.
